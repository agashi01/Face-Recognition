Face Detection Repository
Overview
This repository contains the full source code for a Face Detection project, which includes both the backend server for processing images and the frontend user interface (UI) for interacting with the app. The application detects faces in images using advanced computer vision techniques. The repository allows you to run both the server-side processing and the client-side interface in a single package.
